# VinGris
Add configurability to your enterprise java applications.
The VinGris.xml file will incorporated into your app as soon as it is updated, no need to restart your app.

Step 1:  Build this library, or use the jar file in /dist in your classpath.
Step 2:  Build your application with the jar file from Step 1 in the distribution.
Step 3:  Create a VinGris.xml file similar to the one in /example
Step 4:  Add the -DVinGris=/path/to/VinGris.xml to your application server java command
Step 5:  Update your application for different environments (dev/staging/prod) through the config file, not the code.  Relax more.


The VinGris.xml file should look like the VinGris.xml file example.

Inside your java classes which will be reading configurations (one pattern is to have a ConfigurationReader that responds to requests):
	public static final String VINGRIS_SUITE = "YourCompanyName";      
	    //The above should match the "suite" element's "name" attribute in VinGris.xml
	public static final String VINGRIS_APP   = "YourApplicationName";
	    //The above should match the "application" element's "name" attribute in VinGris.xml
</pre>
